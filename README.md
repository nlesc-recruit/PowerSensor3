## Introduction
PowerSensor is a tool that measures the instantaneous power consumption of PCIe cards and SoC development boards like GPUs, Xeon Phis, FPGAs, DSPs, and network cards, at sub-millisecond time scale. It consists of a commodity microcontroller, commodity current sensors, and (for PCIe devices) a PCIe riser card. The microcontroller reports measurements to the host via USB. A small host library allows an application to determine its own energy efficiency. The high time resolution (up to 8.62 kHz) provides much better insight into energy usage than low-resolution built-in power meters (if available at all), as PowerSensor enables analysis of individual compute kernels.

## Hardware
A PowerSensor measures the instantaneous power use of a GPU:

The PowerSensor consists of an Arduino Leonardo (or Arduino Pro Micro) board, current sensors (ACS712), a PCIe riser card (to measure the power drawn from the motherboard), an optional LCD screen, and a USB cable that connects to the host. In this scenario, we use three sensors that measure the PCIe slot power (12 V and 3.3 V) and the external PCIe cable power. The microcontroller interprets the sensor data and reports the power measurements via USB to the host.

This radio-astronomical pipeline filters, corrects, and correlates the signals from 960 receivers. The figure shows the instantaneous power consumption of three different devices. The correlation between energy use and executed kernels is clearly visible. The shaded area below the curve corresponds to the total energy used by a kernel.

## Disclaimer
You are about to modify electronic circuits.  Improperly connecting wires can be dangerous and may damage computer equipment.  We are not responsible for any harm or damage that might occur.  Make sure that you understand very well how all cables should be connected.  Do not install this tool if you are not absolutely sure what you are doing.

## Installing the PowerSensor
Before starting, turn off and unplug the power of the host system.  An Arduino Uno (or similar clone) is at the heart of the PowerSensor.  The microcontroller on this board collects the sensor values, interprets them, and communicates them to the host via USB.  An optional LCD shield (with 16x2 display) shows the instantaneous power consumption of the (PCIe) device to be measured.

PowerSensor measures currents, using external current sensors (like those from the ACS712 series).  The current sensor, in this case a Hall-effect sensor, measures the current that flows through a wire, and converts the input current to an (analogue) voltage that is directly proportional to the current.  This voltage is sampled by the built-in ADC converter of the Arduino.  PowerSensor assumes that no current (0 Ampere) translates to a 2.5V signal.

To measure the power of a PCIe device, a riser card is necessary, so that the current drawn from the PCIe slot can be measured.  An appropriate rised card is necessary, that allows tapping the 12V and 3.3V power lines.  Also, the riser card should be of sufficient quality, to avoid PCIe bandwidth loss due to poor signalling.  The Adexelec PEXP16-EX will do.  The 12V power line can provide up to 65W (5.4A), so the ACS712-20 is a suitable current sensor.  The 3.3V power line can provide up to 10W (3.0A); this can best be measured using an ACS712-5 current sensor.

A third current sensor is needed to measure the power of an external 12V power cable.  We advise to not cut the PCIe power cables of the power supply directly, but to use an extension cable and cut the 12V wires of the extension cable.  Only cut the 12V wires; the earth wires should not be cut.  Connect both ends of the cut cable to the current sensor.  If the current flows in the wrong direction, PowerSensor will measure negative power, so make sure that the cable is connected correctly.

The voltage output of the current sensor should be connected to any of the ports A1-A5 (A0 is used by the buttons of the LCD shield).  The current sensor can be powered by Arduino bord, by connecting it to the 5V and earth connectors.

Finally, connect the Arduino to a USB port of the host system.  After making sure that everything is connected correctly, turn on the host system.


## Installing the firmware
Make sure that the Arduino tools are installed on host system.  On Ubuntu, one needs the `arduino-core` and `arduino-mk` packages.  If necessary, adapt `Arduino/Makefile` to configure the right Arduino variant.  The device typically appears as `/dev/ttyACM0` after it is connected to the host.  Then, do `make upload` to build and install the firmware on the Arduino.  The PowerSensor will not work properly until its is configured.


## Configuring the PowerSensor
`psconfig` configures the PowerSensor.  The parameters that can be set are the voltages of the lines to be measured, the type of the current sensor, and the null level of the ADC.  The parameters are stored on the device's EEPROM, so the device needs to be configured only once.

There is native support for the ACS712 series current sensors.  Other sensor types may work as well (see the `-t` option below).

PowerSensor supports up to 5 current sensors.  All current sensor ports must be configured, even if not all of them are used.

`psconfig` accepts the parameters as described below.  The order of parameters is important.  Further on, we give examples of full configuration commands for a typical PowerSensor setup.

```
usage: ./bin/x86_64/psconfig [-d device] [-s sensor] [-t type] [-v volt] [-a | -n nullLevel] [-o] [-p]
-d selects the device (default: /dev/ttyACM0)
-s selects the sensor (0-4)
-t selects the sensor type, (one of ACS712-5, ACS712-20, ACS712-30, or a Volt-Per-Ampere value)
-v sets the voltage level
-a auto-calibrates the null level
-n manually sets the null level (the amount of Watt to be added)
-o turns off a sensor
-p prints configured values
```

Parameters that are not specified are left unmodified on the device.

A typical configuration of the PowerSensor is to measure a PCIe device like a
GPU, with current sensor 0 measuring the 12V PCIe slot current, sensor 1
measuring the 3.3V PCIe slot current, and sensor 2 measuring the 12V external
cable current.  A typically way to configure the PowerSensor is as follows:

```
./bin/x86_64/psconfig -d/dev/ttyACM0 -s0 -tACS712-20 -v12 -n0 -s1 -tACS712-5 -v3.3 -n0 -s2 -tACS712-20 -v12 -n0 -s3 -o -s4 -o -p
```

The `-n` values may be adjusted to get the right null levels, depending on the local magnetic field.  An easier way to calibrate them, is to fully turn of the host system power (so that no current is flowing through the current sensors), and to configure the PowerSensor from another machine (by temporarily connecting the USB cable to that other machine).  In this case, the null levels can be configured automatically:

```
$ ./bin/x86_64/psconfig -d/dev/ttyACM0 -s0 -tACS712-20 -v12 -a -s1 -tACS712-5 -v3.3 -a -s2 -tACS712-20 -v12 -a -s3 -o -s4 -o -p
```


## Testing the PowerSensor
To see if the PowerSensor works correctly, one can either use the `-p` option of `psconfig`:
```
$ ./bin/x86_64/psconfig -h
sensor: 0, volt: 12 V, type: ACS712-20, null level: -1.66026 W, current usage: 11.5142 W
sensor: 1, volt: 3.3 V, type: ACS712-5, null level: 0.0223578 W, current usage: 0.262142 W
sensor: 2, volt: 12 V, type: ACS712-20, null level: -1.75054 W, current usage: 11.19 W
sensor: 3, off
sensor: 4, off
```

Or use the `pstest` utility to measure and report energy consumption for a few seconds:
```
$ ./bin/x86_64/pstest
exp. time: 0.0004 s, measured: 0.000476902 s, 0.0597194 J, 125.224 W

exp. time: 3.2768 s, measured: 3.27695 s, 75.2596 J, 22.9663 W
```

## Monitor power use of an existing application
Adapting an application to use the library is not obligatory; the `psrun` utility can monitor the power use of a device during the execution of an application that does not use the library:
```
./bin/x86_64/pstest <application>
< application output >
24.0161 s, 5537,22 J, 230.563 W
```

## Using the host library
The host library is a small C++ library that can be used by applications to measure the power used by some (PCIe) device during some time interval.  The interface (declared in `PowerSensor.h`) looks like this:
```
class PowerSensor {
  public:
    ...
    State read();

    static double Joules(const State &first, const State &second);
    static double Watt(const State &first, const State &second);
    static double seconds(const State &first, const State &second);
};
```
and can be used as follows:
```
#include <PowerSensor.h>

using namespace powersensor;

int main()
{
    PowerSensor sensor("/dev/ttyACM0");
    PowerSensor::State start = sensor.read();
    ...
    PowerSensor::State stop = sensor.read();
    std::cout << "The computation took " << PowerSensor::Joules(start, stop) << 'J' << std::endl;
}
```

This way, the power consumption during some time interval can be used.

Another way to use the PowerSensor is to produce a stream of sensor values on file (in ASCII). Simply provide the name of the file as second (optional) argument to the constructor of PowerSensor.  A separate, light-overhead thread will be started that continuously monitors the PowerSensor state. Both methods can be used at the same time.
